# RobloxPinCrackerPlus

This is forked from https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?tid=1041800, credits to Egypt#2325.

This was improving upon the previous code, with sloppy python practices (i.a. catch-all exceptions). 

## Find your cookie:
To find your cookie, install an extention like https://cookie-editor.cgagnier.ca/, and find the cookie titled `.ROBLOSECURITY`. It should start with 
`_|WARNING:-DO-NOT-SHARE-THIS.--Sharing-this-will-allow-someone-to-log-in-as-you-and-to-steal-your-ROBUX-and-items.|_`.
  
## Running the program:
Assuming you have python installed, simply run the python program through either double clicking or terminal. This is an entirely commandline program. It will automatically create the three text files it needs. It should be fairly self explanatory. 

## Support: 
You could either contact me through email `hi@amanda.ng.eu.org` or contact the support for the official fork, information within the credits section in the program. 

## License:
Since this is a fork, the license is mirrored of the official fork's.
